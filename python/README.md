```bash
pick_episode.py
```
Use ths script to randomly choose an episode from a TV show to watch. Useful when you have already seen the show
and are landing at the same few episodes every time you feel like watching the series again.
Usage: run the script using `python3` interpreter. Required arguments during runtime: Number of seasons, number of episodes.

```bash
rename_subtitles.py
```
Many times when you download subtitles to accompany your television series, they are incorrectly named, i.e., their filenames differ from the video file names (without extension). Media players (such as VLC) automatically initiate subtitles if the filenames leaving extentions match with each other. This script will make these filenames same so that you don't have to manually pick the subtitle file each time you watch something.
Usage: run the script using `python3` interpreter.
